## Switch-Playa

Uses an arduino Pro Micro to automatically input joystick controls for repetitive switch tasks

Based on [wby0322's XenoBlade2-Autofeed](https://github.com/wby0322/XenoBlade2-Autofeed) modifications to [bertrandom's snowball-thrower](https://github.com/bertrandom/snowball-thrower) which couldn't have happened without [Shiny Quagsire'a Splatoon post printer](https://github.com/shinyquagsire23/Switch-Fightstick) and [progmem's original discovery](https://github.com/progmem/Switch-Fightstick)

### Usage
Copy one of the .c files (like ArrowFarm.c) to a new name to create a new autoplay. Then symlink Joystick.c to whatever.c you want to compile for.
